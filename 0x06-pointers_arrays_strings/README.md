 - More Pointers, Arrays, and Strings

This repository contains exercises and examples related to the topic of "More Pointers, Arrays, and Strings" in the C programming language. It aims to further enhance your understanding and proficiency in using pointers, arrays, and strings in C.

## List of Files

- `0-strcat.c`: Function that concatenates two strings.
- `1-strncat.c`: Function that concatenates two strings but with a size limit.
- `2-strncpy.c`: Function that copies a string.
- `3-strcmp.c`: Function that compares two strings.
- `4-rev_array.c`: Function that reverses the content of an array of integers.
- `5-string_toupper.c`: Function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.
- `6-cap_string.c`: Function that capitalizes all words of a string.
- `100-print_number.c`: Function that prints an integer without using long, arrays, or pointers.

## Getting Started

To get started with the files in this repository, follow the instructions below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/0x06-pointers-arrays-strings.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:

   ```shell
   cd 0x06-pointers-arrays-strings
   ```

3. You will find the source files mentioned in the "List of Files" section. Feel free to explore them, modify them, and use them for your learning purposes.

## Compilation

To compile the C files in this repository, you can use a C compiler like `gcc` with the following flags:

```shell
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <source-file.c> -o <output-file>
```

Replace `<source-file.c>` with the name of the C file you want to compile and `<output-file>` with the desired name for the compiled output.

For example, to compile `0-strcat.c`, you can use the following command:

```shell
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic 0-strcat.c -o strcat
```

After compilation, you will have an executable file (`strcat` in the example) that you can run in your terminal.

## Usage

Once you have compiled the C files, you can run them directly from the terminal by executing the corresponding executable file. For example:

```shell
./strcat
```

The program will run, and you can follow the prompts or observe the output as per the functionality of each specific C file.
