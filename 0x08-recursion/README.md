This is a README for the ALX 0x08-recursion Project.

What is Recursion.
Recursion is simply when a function is calling it self between its own function, it can alo be called the solving of a larger problem with the use of smaller individual steps.

A recursion can be used in c to solve mathematical problems like factorial, etc.
while using a recursion without specifying the base case you will enter into an infinite loop and your program will crash when memory has been exhausted.

this is all for now about recursion. 

Thank you for reading.
