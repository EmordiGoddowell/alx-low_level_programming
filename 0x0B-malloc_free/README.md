This is a Readme for the project malloc - memory allocation.

This is the process whereby a user assigns a number of memory or byte to a particular variable.

the process involves calling the malloc and assigning the valve to it and at the very end call a free function to stop the process of the memory allocation to avoid a buffer overflow.

Valgrind is a kind of debugger used in debugging faults in memory allocation. or i'll say Itâ€™s a program to validate memory allocation.
