**0x0C. C - More malloc, free**
This project is about learning how to use the `malloc` and `free` functions in C to allocate and deallocate memory dynamically.

The `malloc` function is used to allocate a block of memory on the heap. The `free` function is used to deallocate a block of memory that was allocated with `malloc`.

In this project, you will be working on the following tasks:

* Allocate a block of memory on the heap and store a string in it.
* Print the string that was stored in the allocated memory.
* Deallocate the allocated memory.
* Allocate an array of integers on the heap and print the elements of the array.
* Deallocate the allocated array.

**To complete this project, you will need to:**

* Understand the difference between the stack and the heap.
* Be able to use the `malloc` and `free` functions.
* Be able to handle errors that may occur when allocating or deallocating memory.

**Once you have completed this project, you will be able to:**

* Allocate and deallocate memory dynamically using `malloc` and `free`.
* Handle errors that may occur when allocating or deallocating memory.
