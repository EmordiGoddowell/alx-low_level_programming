What is a Linked List:

	A linked list is a fundamental data structure in computer science used to store and organize data. It consists of a sequence of elements called "nodes," where each node contains two parts:

1. Data: This part holds the actual value or payload that the node is storing. It can be any type oof data, such as an integer, string, or a complex data structure.

2. Pointer (or Link): This part points to the next node in the sequence. It essentially establishesthe connection between nodes and is what differentiates linked lists from arrays.

The last node in the list typically points to a special value (often NULL in C) to indicate the end of the list.

There are different types of linked lists, but the most basic form is the singly linked list. In a singly linked list, each node contains a link only to the next node in the sequence.
